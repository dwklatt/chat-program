This project was originally a homework assignment (can be seen under hw3 in my crypto repository) created by Me and my friends/group Sean O'Byrne and Brad Messer.  It was a simple little chat program that uses an El Gamal cryptography system to pass a secret key so that it can then use an AES cryptography system to pass encrypted messages.  My goal is to make it better and feel more like a instant message program.
